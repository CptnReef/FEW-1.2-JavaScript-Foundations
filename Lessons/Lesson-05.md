# Bundling

Bundling is a common practice used across the JS eco system. While JS is not compiled to source code like other languages, JS files are processed heavily in modern applications. 

<!-- > -->

## Why learn bundling?

- It's profesional best practice
- Expect this to be used in any software job using JS
- Make more reliable apps
- Make more widelt compatible applications

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Describe bundling
1. Identify the advnatages of bundling code
1. Implement a bundling system

## Intro

Has anyone used bundling or JS compiler before? 

What did it do? 

## Bundling JS

Modern JS applications are not just written in code and used. At the profesional level they are compiled/bundled. 

JavaScript is a scripting language. This means it doesn't need to be compiled in a strict sense, processed and turned into machine code. 

While it doesn't need to turned into machine code we can still do work to make our code more reliable and compatible the widest array of browsers. 

A bundler is a tool that converts the source JS that you wrote into code that will be used in your published application/web site. 

<!-- > -->

What does bundling do? Processes your sources file and produces new files. What kinds of processes? 

- minify - reduces file size by removing unnecessary characters
- uglify - renames elements to obfuscate code and reduce file size again
- Compile TypeScript - Converts .ts files into .js files
- Compatibility - Convert ES6 JS into JS that compatible with older browsers
- bundling - combining all .js files into a single bundle.js

Paste some code here and see what the output is. 

Expect to use bundlers on any professional project or in a professional environment.
