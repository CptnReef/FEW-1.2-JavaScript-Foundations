# FEW 1.2 Foundation JavaScript

## Course Description

Deepen your understanding of the JavaScript language by creating games. 

During this course you will build three games with the mindset of someone working on, maintaining, and updating a codebase that you are responsible for. Along the way you will work with many core features of the JavaScript language. 

### Why you should take this class

JavaScript is one of the most important languages in use today. You work with itt daily in everything you interact with from web sites, to mobile applications, to embedded IoT devices. Applications built with JavaScript have the highest potential impact and lowest barrier to entry. If you want to create an application and put in front of the widest array of users you'll probably want to built it with JavaScript.

## Class Assignments [Remove header if you like]
- List (with links) of all course-level assignments (i.e. tutorials, challenge sets, contractor project, custom projects, etc)
- Under each assignment link the rubric used to evaluate it or describe how it is evaluated.
- Projects should be linked to a project page which has a description & requirements.

### Tutorials
[REWORD AS RELEVANT TO YOUR COURSE] Tutorials are to help you get started in a topic.  They are graded on completion only.

- [Do Cool Stuff Tutorial]()

### Projects
**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class. 

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

[REWORD AS RELEVANT TO YOUR COURSE] Projects are a chance for you to build and ship code that is based on class concepts.  Many are open ended allowing you to be creative and to have individual work for your portfolio.

    -   [Sample Project Rubric](Sample_Rubric.md)

### Other Class assignments

## Evaluation
[MAKE SPECIFIC TO YOUR COURSE SO IT IS SUPER CLEAR]
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials 
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
