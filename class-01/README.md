# FEW 1.2 - Class 1

## Learn JavaScript by making games!

You're hired! Consider this class your job for the next 7 weeks. You'll be responsible for making three games, maintaining and improving the code base for your games, keeping notes and documentation for the code that you produce.

It's your job to put in regular hours working on the code you are responsible for.

You will maintain a GitHub Repo for each project. **You need to commit each time you work on the project. For each session you work you should have at least one commit.** This is a requirement.

You'll be working on three games:

- Breakout - the arcade classic
- Oregon Trail - one of the most successful games of all time!
- Platform Game built with Phaser 3 JS

## Breakout with JS

[Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) is a classic arcade game. It's simple and has been ported to almost every platform. Your job is to make the JavaScript version.

Your goal is to build the tutorial here:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

The tutorial here is short. You should be able to finish it in an evening.

## Homework

Read the tutorial and complete the game. Your tutorial should be functional! The tutorial shows the complete sample code at the end of every section. You can test your process against this as you work. Test your work and play the game!

Study the code and and do your best to understand how the code functions and why the game behaves as it does. Look closely at the game, be sure to play. Change some of the values and see how they effect the game.

After completing the tutorial You will be working on challenges based on the tutorial. This is why it is essential that your tutorial be functioning when you come to class 2.

### Why do this tutorial?

This tutorial makes a simple which in iteself is not too exciting. Looking deeper it has a majority of the JavaScript language features you will have to master to be an expert at JS! Might as well learn them by making a game!

The tutorial contains:

- functions
- variables
- Arrays
- Objects
- loops
- if then statements

It is essential that you master these features to make a career in Software developement. Using these features to solve problems and create solutions is an important skill. This tutorial solves some interesting problems using all of these tools. Trying your best to understand the problems that are being solved in the tutorial will help you at technical job interviews in the future!
