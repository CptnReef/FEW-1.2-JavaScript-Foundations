You're hired! Consider this class your job for the next 7 weeks. You'll be responsible for making three games, maintaining and improving the code base for your games, keeping notes and documentation for the code that you produce. 

It's your job to put in regular hours working on the code you are responsible for. 

You will maintain a GitHub Repo for each project. **You need to commit each time you work on the project. For each session you work you should have at least one commit.** This is a requirement.

The tutorial here is short. You should be able to finish it in an evening. 

## Homework

Read the tutorial and complete the game. You can copy and paste the code samples. Your tutorial should be functional! Test your work and play the game. 

Study the code and and do your best to understand how the code functions and why the game behaves as it does. Look closely at the game, be sure to play. Change some of the values and see how they effect the game.
