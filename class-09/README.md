# FEW 1.2 Class 9

Lab day work and problem solving. 

## Aside: Why? 

Why are we learning all of the Class syntax? React!

React uses this class syntax heavily. Besides the 
syntax the component based architecture relies classes 
to define components. 

Games are just for fun. Really you're solving all the 
same problems you'd be solving in software sans games. 

- Arrays, multi-dimensional arrays
- Objects, properties, methods, classes
- Handing events
- Dependancy Injection
- etc. 

All of therse things occur and are aprt of solutions 
that you will 

## Lab and Review

Students work in groups to solve problems. Students offer problems they are having, list these on board. 

**Discuss problems and solutions.**

Group/pair students to work together for a 15 to 20 min block of time with the goal of solving one of the problems from the list. 

**Take a break**

Repeat the process again mixing group/pairs.

End class with a review of the problems and solutions that were developed during class.
