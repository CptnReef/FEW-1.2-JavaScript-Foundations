# FEW 1.2 Phaser

Phaser is a library for making games in JS. 

Phaser is pretty sophisticated it takes all of the objects you migth have created in the break out game, expands on them. 

Phaser uses canvas to render objects to the screen. Phaser breaks all of the common tasks into classes that can be reused. 

## Getting started

Why learn Phaser JS? Currently there are more JS libraries 
written for JS than any other language. Learning to get into 
and apply a library is an important skill. 

The Phaser 3 library is very complex. Learning Phaser isn't 
about learning Phaser. Instead it's about learning how to 
read documentation, apply methods and classes from a library
that you didn't write. This is a valuable job skill and an 
important skill every developer has to learn. 

Learning Phaser also gives you a chance to see the same problems
you solved earlier with vanilla JS were solved with a high 
degree of abstraction. If you kept evolving your previous 
games you would end up with a library like phaser, after some 
years of developement! Seriously. 

This is class is not about games. It's about learning JS. 

### Phaser 3

Phaser is a game library written in JS. The latest version is 3. 
There is a lot of documentation written for version 2. For this 
assignment you must use version 3! When you check the notes, 
tutorials, and documentation part of your jonb will be to 
verify that the information you are researching applies to 
version 3. 

If not you'll need convert the infromation, code snippets, 
examples, tutorials, etc. to Phaser version 3. 

### The local server and CORS

Before getting started we need to understand web browsers, security, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). 
CORS is an issue you will run into often working with JavaScript as your applications get more complex. 

In short the browser puts limits to what files can be accessed via JavaScript in the browser. This is a good thing for an end user but places a burden on you as a devleoper. 

To test Phaser locally you'll need to run a local server. Follow the guide [here](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3)

### Phaser Tutorial

Everyone is talking about libraries. They seem to be the big thing is web development. Anything bigger than a small project could use a library to save time and make it easier to implement sophisticated features. 

You've decided to make another game. Rather than write it all from scratch you've decided to use a library! This will allow you to implement complext features without having to invent them on your own from scratch. You heard [Phaser JS](https://phaser.io) is pretty good, and they just came out with version 3, time to code! 

You really need to learn some Phaser! Start with the tutorial. This tutorial creates a simple [platform game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game).

### Alternate Tutorials

Here are a few alternate tutorials you try instead of the 
tutorial above. It's strictly up to you which you choose. 

- [Flappy Bird](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1)
- [Breakout](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/breakout-phaser)
- [2D Platformer](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/2d-platformer-phaser)

## Challenges 

**Challenge 1**: Get your local server running

Choose your favorite method from the [Getting started with Phaser](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3) section. Make sure you can run the server when needed. Take some notes, you'll need to launch your server every time you work on your project. 

**Challenge 2**: Complete the tutorial. 

This tutorial is involved and has a lot new ideas. Take notes along the way. There are lot of new concepts here. 
you'll want to revisit these ideas after you have completed the tutorial. 

## Stretch Challenges 

**Stretch Challenge 1**: If you have completed the tutorial try changing the artwork. 
This is a good start to learning how the system works. Check out these resources or make your own.
