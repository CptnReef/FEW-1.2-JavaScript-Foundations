# FEW 1.2 Class 11

Solving problems and researching documentation. 

## Intro

reading the documention is key to working with any library. The only 
reason you understand the code you write is becuase you wrote it. 
Not one expects you to understand what parameters are required for 
method that you have never heard of.

This is why documentation exists. 

## OOP

A class allows you to wrap all of the functions and variables, this 
the actions and data required by a system, into a single element 
called an object. 

Objects are great because they encapsulate, store methods and 
properties in one place. They are also reproducible, that is you can 
as many instances of an object from a class as you might need. 

Together these last two points are why it's worth learning Object 
Oriented Programming. 

## Extending Classes

A Class needs to be generic enough to useful but this can also be a
frustration when a class either doesn't do enough, it's too generic, or 
does too much and is so specific it can't be reused. 

Inheritence to the rescue! Any class can be extended. By extending a 
class you are making a new Class that gains all of the properties 
and method from another class and 

The Phaser's classes exist for you to use. You can use them as is. 

In some cases they also may not have all of the functionality that 
you might need for your uses. In these cases you can extend those 
classes to the things that are specific to the needs of your project.
