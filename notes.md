FEW 1.2

Projects on GitHub as GitHub pages? Maybe a page with links...

Identify where students are weak and assign exercises. These could be Code Academy or Repls etc. 

Class is like work you are responsible for solving the problems presented and putting in the hours each week. You must show up to work and be present. 

Each class has objectives with challenges. The goal is to understand the objectives by solving challenges. Challenges stretch by moving deeper into the objective topics. 

Each class has pre class study information. Usually an article, video, short tutorial. Students should do this before class.

Students need to leave each class with an understanding of what to do, how to approach the challenges, and the tools to use to solve the challenges before the next class. 

Each class should present 3 hours of challenge problems for a weekly 6 hours of outside work.

The canvas element that Phaser creates will be simply be appended to the document at the point the script was called, but you can also specify a parent container in the game config should you wish.


Project one - Oregon Trail

Rationale 

Students will work with existing Code base. They will solder Code in raw JS form and update that Code to modern standards. 

The project will cover class based OOP architecture. It will cover some design patterns. Object/namespace, module, eventlistener, 

treated like a small but fairly complex Code base. 
There is room to explore the code make changes. 
Add features by understanding the code. 
Code is 100% vanilla JS 
There will a goal to update the to more modern syntax
Improve the Code base using OOP
Possibly writing tests



Project 2 - phaser js

building a game with phaser 

Remove events to a new file import these. Define a class for events and instantiate for each event. 






Todo Friday 

Define passing requirements for mob 1.1
Create a concept assessment for mob 1.1
Define passing requirements for few 1.1
Create concepts assessment for few 1.1
Few final assignment: browser api project repo with project write 500 words.

Text adventure 

A giant object stores locations as objects with descriptions. This acts as a world.
Players navigate the world by issuing commnds left, right, up, down. 
The game checks the location and prints the description from the world object.
